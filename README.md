# Emojis
Please find the cheatsheet in the [wiki](https://github.com/itecompro/markdown-emoji-cheatsheet/wiki) :point_left:

# How it works
I update the files in this repo and then run a code locally to generate a complete MD file that I then manually commit to the wiki. Hopefully, this process will be improved/automated in the future. Any suggestion is welcome. The files are updated based on [GitHub Emojis API](https://api.github.com/emojis) as at v8.

# Improvements
Currently, there are a great deal of emojis in [UncategorizedCodes.txt](https://github.com/itecompro/markdown-emoji-cheatsheet/blob/master/UncategorizedCodes.txt), which are kind of categorized, but they still need to be put in the category files in the best place. For example, if there is `chicken` in the UncategorizedCodes.txt under the Nature title, it means that it will go to the Nature.txt file. But, I don't want to add the `chicken` to the end of Nature.txt, or in the middle of a `cow` or `pig`! :wink: It's best to put it probably somewhere around `duck`! I have done some of them and would try to do more, but any help from the community would be highly appreciated.
