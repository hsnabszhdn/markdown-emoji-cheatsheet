# Emojis
Please find the cheatsheet in the [wiki](https://github.com/itecompro/markdown-emoji-cheatsheet/wiki) :point_left:

# How it works
I update the files in this repo and then run a code locally to generate a complete MD file that I then manually commit to the wiki. Hopefully, this process will be improved/automated in the future. Any suggestion is welcome. The files are updated based on (GitHub Emojis API)[https://api.github.com/emojis] as at v8.

# Improvements
Currently, there are a great deal of emojis in [UncategorizedCodes.txt](https://github.com/itecompro/markdown-emoji-cheatsheet/blob/master/UncategorizedCodes.txt), which are kind of categorized, but they still need to be put in the category files in the best place. For example, in the file, you would see that `compass` is put under the Objects title, but I don't want to just dump it at the end of the [Objects.txt](https://github.com/itecompro/markdown-emoji-cheatsheet/blob/master/Categories/Objects.txt) file. It's best to find the correct place among all the objects to put `compass`. I have done some of them and would try to do more, but any help from the community would be highly appreciated.
