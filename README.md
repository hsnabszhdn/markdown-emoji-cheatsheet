# Emojis
Please find the exported images in the [Wiki](https://github.com/itecompro/markdown-emoji-cheatsheet/wiki)

# How it works
I update the files in this repo and then run a code locally to generate a complete MD file that I then upload to the Wiki. Hopefully, this process will be improved/automated in the future.

# Improvements
Currently, there are a great deal of emojis in [UncategorizedCodes.txt](https://github.com/itecompro/markdown-emoji-cheatsheet/blob/master/UncategorizedCodes.txt), which are kind of categorized, but they need to be put in the category files in the best place. I have done some of them, but any help from the community would be appreciated.
