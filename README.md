# Emojis
Please find the github-flavored markdown emoji cheatsheet in the [wiki](https://github.com/itecompro/markdown-emoji-cheatsheet/wiki) :point_left:

# How to change
- Change the files in the [Categories](https://github.com/itecompro/markdown-emoji-cheatsheet/tree/master/ConsoleApp1/Files/Categories) folder
  - if you see `unordered` in one of the files, any items after that have been added in an unordered manner and need to be placed in the correct place in the file. For example,  `chicken` must be placed around `duck` and `swan` not `cow` or `pig` or just at the end of the file!
- Run the C# program locally
- Commit the `Home.md` file from `bin/Debug/Files/Categories/` to the wiki repo
